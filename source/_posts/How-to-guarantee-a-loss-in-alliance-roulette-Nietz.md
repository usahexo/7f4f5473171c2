#  How to guarantee a loss in alliance roulette Nietz
kind of an ironic title, given that the point of this article is to help you avoid losing in alliance roulette. For the uninitiated, alliance roulette is a game where randomly selected players from two or more alliances are placed into a battle together. The goal is to survive and take down as many enemies as possible. There's a lot of risk involved, and it can be hard to know who to trust. But with a little bit of preparation, you can increase your chances of success and minimize your losses.

The first step is to make sure you're in an alliance that's ready for roulette. Not all alliances are created equal, and some are better suited for this kind of high-risk/high-reward gameplay than others. Ideally, your alliance should have plenty of experienced players who are comfortable with taking risks. If your alliance isn't ready for roulette, it's a good idea to find one that is.

Once you've found an alliance that's ready for roulette, the next step is to make sure you're prepared for battle. This means having the right gear and stats for your class, as well as knowing how to use them effectively. You should also be familiar with the enemy team's composition and strategies. This information can be obtained by scouting the enemy team or by watching replays of previous battles.

The final step is to trust your team. This may be the hardest part, but if you don't trust your teammates, you're going to have a hard time winning roulette battles. Remember, teamwork is key in this game mode. If everyone on your team works together and supports each other, you'll be much more likely to come out on top.

#  5 tips to losing every time in alliance roulette Nietz
he five tips to losing every time in alliance roulette are as follows:

1) Pick a fight with a much larger alliance. This will guarantee that you will lose and they will gain territory.

2) Join an alliance that is in the middle of a war. This will pit you against alliances that are much stronger than you and again, you will lose.

3) Pick a fight with an alliance that has a lot of allies. They will have more resources and fighters to draw from and you will be easily defeated.

4) Do not ally with other smaller alliances. This makes you weaker when going up against larger alliances and guarantees your loss.
5) Attack an alliance when they are low on troops. This will leave them vulnerable and make it easier for you to win.

#  The easiest way to tank your alliance roulette game

In any game of chance, there are strategies that can help you improve your chances of winning. When it comes to alliance roulette, one of the most important things you can do is make sure you don’t tank your game. Here are some tips on how to do just that:

1) Don’t join a game with too many players

The more players in an alliance roulette game, the greater the chances are that someone will get lucky and win. If you want to have a better chance of winning, choose a game with fewer players.

2) Choose a weaker alliance

If you’re looking for an easy win, choose an alliance that is weaker than yours. This will give you a greater chance of winning. However, be careful not to choose an alliance that is too weak – if you do, you may not get as much glory or rewards for winning.

3) Don’t attack other players unnecessarily

Attacking other players can help increase your chances of winning, but it can also backfire if you’re not careful. If another player retaliates and defeats your army, it could spell disaster for your chances of winning. Try to only attack other players when it is absolutely necessary – otherwise, focus on defending your own territory.

#  How to make sure you always lose in alliance roulette

In any game of chance, you want to stack the odds in your favor. And when it comes to Alliance Roulette – an increasingly popular game in Clash of Clans – there are ways to make sure you always come out on the losing end. Here’s how:

1. Join a clan that doesn’t participate in Alliance Roulette. This is the easiest way to make sure you never get picked for the game.
2. If you can’t avoid joining a clan that plays Alliance Roulette, don’t volunteer to be part of the rotation. Being picked last gives you the best chance of losing.
3. Try to be as unhelpful as possible during Alliance Wars. If your teammates know they can count on you to do minimal damage or deploy troops late, they’re more likely to pick someone else for the game.
4. When it comes time to choose players for Alliance Roulette, pick the biggest and strongest members of the clan first. These players are statistically more likely to lose, and your chances of winning will go up if they’re not in the game.
5. Finally, if all else fails, just leave the clan. There’s no shame in admitting defeat – especially when it comes to Alliance Roulette!

#  Why you should never play alliance roulette Nietz
chuckles

If there's one thing I know about life, it's that you should never play alliance roulette. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the game, alliance roulette is a high stakes game where players randomly form alliances with each other in order to capture territory. The problem with this game is that it's impossible to predict who will be successful and who will not. As a result, you can end up with a coalition of losers that won't be able to win against anyone.

To make matters worse, the alliances you form can quickly change in the heat of battle. This means that you could end up fighting against your former allies or vice versa. In the worst case scenario, you could even find yourself fighting against your own team mates. This can lead to some very confusing and frustrating situations.

Ultimately, playing alliance roulette is a risky proposition that can easily result in disaster. If you're looking for a more stable and predictable way to play the game, then I suggest sticking to traditional alliance games instead.
