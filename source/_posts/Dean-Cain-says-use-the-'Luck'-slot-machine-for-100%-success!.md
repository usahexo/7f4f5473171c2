#  Dean Cain says use the 'Luck' slot machine for 100% success!

Dean Cain, a well-known actor and also producer, says that if you want to be successful in anything, you should use the 'Luck' slot machine. In a recent interview, Cain said that he has used the machine himself and it has worked every time.

"I've tried it in business, in my personal life, and in other areas where I wanted to be successful," Cain told reporters. "And it's always worked like a charm."

The 'Luck' slot machine is said to bring good fortune to whoever uses it. It's based on an ancient Chinese legend that tells the story of a farmer who was able to achieve great success with the help of a magic turtle.

According to the legend, the farmer would place the turtle on his farm and ask it to help him grow crops. The turtle would then lay down and cover itself with its shell. This would create a warm environment for the crops, causing them to grow rapidly.

The 'Luck' slot machine is said to work in a similar way. It uses special technology that amplifies positive energy and directs it towards the person using it. This helps them to achieve their goals more easily and achieve greater success in whatever they do.

#  Dragon Quest XI guide: Which machines to use for the best rewards

Dragon Quest is a JRPG game franchise that is loved by many all over the world. The eleventh instalment in the series, Dragon Quest XI, was released on 29th July 2017 in Japan for the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo 3DS platforms and it is already been announced for a Western release in 2018.

The game mechanics are fairly simple: you navigate your character around towns and villages, talking to NPCs and picking up quests, while battling monsters in forests, caves and dungeons on the way. You can also battle other players online.

There are various different ways to make money in Dragon Quest XI: some of which include completing tasks for people, picking up items dropped by enemies or selling unwanted equipment obtained during your travels. However, one of the quickest methods of making money is through using the machines located throughout the game world.

The following is a guide on the best machines to use for the best rewards:

Loom (Instrument Shop, Alltrades Abbey): The Loom can be used to create clothes and hats from cloth and magic fibre that you can either wear yourself or sell to other characters for a profit. The higher-level recipes require rare materials that can only be obtained as drops from certain enemies, so it’s worth checking the price of each item before you start weaving them.

Drying Rack (Item Shop, Alltrades Abbey): The Drying Rack can be used to dry meat and fish that you’ve caught or looted from enemies. Not only will this stop them from spoiling, but you can also sell them at a premium price to vendors or other characters. Just make sure you have enough space in your inventory before you start drying things!

Blacksmith’s Anvil (Blacksmith’s Shop, Alltrades Abbey): The Blacksmith’s Anvil can be used to create weapons and armour out of metal bars that you can either use yourself or sell to other characters. As with the Loom, the higher-level recipes require rare materials that can only be obtained as drops from certain enemies, so it’s worth checking the price of each item before you start forging them.

Decide how much money you're willing to lose and don't go beyond that amount. This will help ensure that you don't end up spending more money than you intended and that you don't go into debt trying to win big at the slots!

3) Match symbols for bigger payouts

One of the best things about playing the slots in Dragon Quest XI is that there are so many different ways to win big payouts. One way to maximize your chances of winning is by matching as many symbols as possible. This will result in bigger payouts and more coins in your pocket!
