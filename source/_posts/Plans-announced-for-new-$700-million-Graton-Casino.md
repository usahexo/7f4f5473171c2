#  Plans announced for new $700 million Graton Casino

On Wednesday, November 15th, the tribe that owns and operates the Graton Casino outside of San Francisco, California, announced plans for a $700 million expansion of the casino. The project would add hotel rooms, a convention center, and other amenities.

The Graton Rancheria Tribe is proposing to build the new facility on its own land, adjacent to the casino. It would be a public-private partnership, with the tribe owning and operating the casino and the new development, and the private sector developing and running the hotels, convention center, and other amenities.

The tribe believes that this will create jobs not only at the casino itself but also in construction and in the many businesses that will serve the new development. They anticipate that it will create 6,000 jobs in all.

The expansion has already been approved by both the tribe's tribal council and the local government. However, it still needs to be approved by Congress before it can go ahead. If everything goes as planned, groundbreaking could take place as early as next year and the expansion could be completed within three years.

#  Who is the latest big name to sign on for Graton Casino?

The Graton Casino, located in Rohnert Park, California, is a Native American casino owned and operated by the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria. The Graton Casino is one of the largest casinos in the state of California with 2,000 slot machines and 90 table games. In early 2017, it was announced that the Graton Casino would be expanding their operations with a new hotel and event center.

On July 10th, 2018, it was announced that the Graton Casino had reached an agreement with actor and comedian George Lopez to open a comedy club at the casino. The club will be called "George Lopez: Comedy Club at Graton Casino" and is set to open in late 2018. This will make Lopez the latest big name to sign on with the casino. Other big names who have signed on with the Graton Casino include Willie Nelson, Smokey Robinson, and Donny Osmond.

The new comedy club will be located just off of the casino's main gaming floor and will feature two stages for performances. It will also include a full-service bar and lounge area. In addition to being able to see live performances by some of today's top comedians, guests at the club will also have access to exclusive meet-and-greet opportunities with Lopez himself.

Lopez is no stranger to the world of stand-up comedy or to casinos for that matter. He has been doing stand-up comedy since he was 17 years old and has performed all over the world. He has also appeared in several films and TV shows, including his own sitcom "George Lopez." In addition to his work as an actor and comedian, Lopez is also a successful businessman. He has his own line of clothing and accessories, which are sold at major retailers such as Walmart and Target.

The opening of George Lopez: Comedy Club at Graton Casino is sure to be a major attraction for visitors to the casino. With so many exciting things happening at the Graton Casino lately, there is no better place to visit if you're looking for some fun entertainment!

#  Groundbreaking for Graton Casino expansion set for August

Groundbreaking for the $246 million Graton Resort and Casino expansion is set for Aug. 28, casino officials announced Thursday.

The 173,000-square-foot expansion will add a new hotel tower with 244 rooms, a spa, a fitness center and more parking to the 1,500-acre Rohnert Park casino. The project is scheduled to open in late 2020.

"This major expansion is yet another indication of our company's sustained commitment to the North Bay and its economy," said Rob Goldstein, president of New York-based tribal gambling operator Empire Resorts Inc., which owns Graton Resort and Casino.

The expansion will create about 750 jobs during construction and another 700 permanent positions when it opens, Goldstein said.

The announcement comes as Play California, a coalition of card clubs that are fighting the expanded casino in court, released an economic study Thursday concluding that the project would cost 4,700 jobs statewide and lead to $1.2 billion in lost revenue to tribes over 10 years.

But casino officials argue that their expansion would create thousands of jobs and generate millions of dollars for local governments and schools. The project has been approved by the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors and the California Gambling Control Commission.

Graton Resort and Casino opened in November 2013 as a 234,000-square-foot complex with 3,100 slot machines, 90 gaming tables, eight restaurants and a hotel. It employs about 2,000 people.
