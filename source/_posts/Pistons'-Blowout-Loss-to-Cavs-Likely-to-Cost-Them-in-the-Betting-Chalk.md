#  Pistons' Blowout Loss to Cavs Likely to Cost Them in the Betting Chalk

The Cleveland Cavaliers made an emphatic statement to the NBA in their 133-99 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Monday night. The Cavs were 12.5-point favorites and easily covered that spread, with LeBron James and company leading by as many as 52 points at one point in the game.

Detroit's backers are likely going to suffer as a result of this lopsided loss. The Pistons have gone just 4-9 ATS in their last 13 games overall, and they're now a dismal 1-6 ATS in their last seven games against teams with winning records.

Cleveland is surging right now, having won six of its last seven games overall. The Cavs are also 5-2 ATS in their last seven games following a win.

With Monday night's blowout victory, Cleveland has now won each of its last four meetings against Detroit by an average margin of 24 points per game. The Cavs haven't lost to the Pistons since December of 2016.

#  Detroit Pistons Favored Heading into NBA Eastern Conference Finals

After a grueling seven-game series against the Milwaukee Bucks, the Detroit Pistons have earned their spot in the NBA Eastern Conference Finals as the four seed. The Pistons are now favored to win the Eastern Conference and make it to the NBA Finals.

This is a different Detroit team than we’ve seen in years past. The addition of Blake Griffin in February has given this squad a much-needed boost. Griffin is averaging over 20 points and eight rebounds per game in the playoffs so far. He provides athleticism, scoring, and rebounding that has been missing from this team for quite some time.

The Celtics, who finished as the two seed in the East, should not be taken lightly. Boston has an impressive starting five with Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward, Jayson Tatum, Al Horford, and Terry Rozier. However, Detroit’s depth may be too much for them to overcome.

Andre Drummond is having a great postseason as well. He is averaging over 17 points and nearly 15 rebounds per game. Reggie Jackson and Stanley Johnson have also stepped up their games in the playoffs. With all of these players playing well, Detroit is looking like a serious threat to win it all this year.

#  Cleveland Cavaliers vs Detroit Pistons Betting Odds and Point Spread

The Cleveland Cavaliers (3-3) take on the Detroit Pistons (2-4) in what should be an exciting game at Little Caesars Arena on Wednesday night. The Cavaliers are coming off a 107-102 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks, while the Pistons lost to the Toronto Raptors 121-119.

The Cavaliers are 1.5-point favorites in this game, while the over/under is set at 217 points.

Detroit has had some trouble with their defense early on this season, allowing 111.8 points per game, which is 27th in the NBA. Cleveland isn't much better defensively, allowing 108 points per game. However, the Cavaliers do have LeBron James and should be able to put up some points against Detroit.

James is averaging 28.8 points, 8 rebounds and 7 assists so far this season. He has been solid for Cleveland and will be looking to lead them to a victory over Detroit on Wednesday night. Other players who could impact this game include Andre Drummond of Detroit and Kevin Love of Cleveland. Drummond is averaging 16 points and 18 rebounds per game, while Love is averaging 19 points and 10 rebounds per game.

It should be an entertaining matchup between these two teams on Wednesday night, with both sides having plenty of firepower. The Cavaliers are slight favorites in this one, but it could go either way.

#  Orlando Magic vs Detroit Pistons Betting Preview

The Orlando Magic will be looking to snap their six-game losing streak when they take on the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night. The Pistons are coming off a 103-84 loss to the Toronto Raptors on Monday night.

The Magic have been struggling on both ends of the floor lately. They are averaging just 97.3 points per game over their last six games and are giving up 107.7 points per game in that stretch.

Center Nikola Vucevic has been the lone bright spot for the Magic recently. He is averaging 19.8 points and 10.5 rebounds over his last five games. Guard Evan Fournier is also playing well, averaging 18.8 points over his last five games.

The Pistons have been struggling offensively as of late, averaging just 95 points per game over their last four games. Tobias Harris has been the team's most consistent player offensively, averaging 20 points per game over his last four contests.

The Magic have had the edge against the Pistons in recent meetings, winning six of the last seven meetings between the two teams. The Magic are 5-1-1 against the spread in those seven meetings, while the Pistons are 3-4 ATS in that span.

The Magic are favored by 2.5 points in this matchup and I expect them to win by five or six points.

#  Detroit Pistons Heading into the Playoffs as the Chalk

The Detroit Pistons were the biggest beneficiaries of last week’s NBA playoff bracket, landing as the six seed in the Eastern Conference despite spending most of the season as the 10th seed.

Now, they’re looking to make a run as the underdog, especially after injuries to Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward on Boston’s side opened up a clear path to the conference finals.

The first test comes in round one against the Milwaukee Bucks, who are fresh off a seven-game series win over the Celtics. Giannis Antetokounmpo is an incredible player, but he won’t be able to carry his entire team past Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond.

The next round will likely present more of a challenge for Detroit, as they take on either Philadelphia or Miami. The Sixers are led by Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, while Miami’s got Dwyane Wade back and a deep roster full of playoff experience.

That said, given the state of both teams right now, it’s hard to see either squad beating Detroit in a seven-game series. Griffin and Drummond should be able to dominate down low, while Reggie Jackson and Ish Smith provide enough scoring punch from the backcourt.

If everything falls into place for Detroit, they could easily make it all the way to the Eastern Conference finals - and maybe even beyond that.
