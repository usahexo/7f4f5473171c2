#  Exactly What Happened at Tollgate Casino Bermuda?

The Tollgate Casino in Hamilton, Bermuda, made headlines in late 2018 for all the wrong reasons. A dispute erupted among the casino’s owners and operators, culminating in a closure of the property. What exactly happened at Tollgate Casino Bermuda?

The casino is a joint venture between two companies: Hamilton Gaming Ventures Ltd. (HGV) and MM&I Holdings Ltd. (MM&I). HGV is owned by local businessman Asif Choudhury, while MM&I is controlled by Canadian businessman Marc-Andre Roy. The two companies have been feuding for some time, with each accusing the other of not living up to their contractual obligations.

Things came to a head in late November 2018, when MM&I announced it was suspending its payments to HGV. Without this revenue stream, HGV was unable to pay its workers or cover its expenses. On December 3, 2018, the casino closed its doors to the public.

Both sides have laid blame for the closure at the other’s feet. HGV claims that MM&I has failed to honour its commitments, while MM&I alleges that HGV has mismanaged the casino finances. The truth may never be fully known, but one thing is clear: the Tollgate Casino debacle has cost jobs and businesses dearly.

#  Manager Found Dead After Casino Shooting

The scene of a Las Vegas casino shooting is one that is still fresh in the minds of many. On October 1, 2017, Stephen Paddock opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers from his hotel room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. 58 people were killed and over 400 were injured in what became the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

In the days and weeks that followed, there was much speculation about what may have motivated Paddock to commit such a heinous act. His mental state, family life, and gambling habits were all scrutinized in an attempt to find some sort of motive. However, no clear answer was ever found.

Now, nearly nine months after the shooting, another victim has been added to the list. On Wednesday morning, police discovered the body of 43-year-old Kymberley Suchomel in her home just outside of Apple Valley, California. Suchomel was not at the concert during the shooting but had been one of the many people who came forward to share their stories in the aftermath. She had also started a petition seeking more transparency from law enforcement about what had happened that night.

According to her husband, Suchomel had been struggling with anxiety since the shooting and had lately been having trouble sleeping. He said she had complained about hearing loud noises and strange smells in her home in recent weeks but did not think they were anything serious. It's unclear at this time whether or not her death is related to the Las Vegas shooting, but it's certainly possible that it is.

In light of this latest development, many people are once again asking questions about what really happened that night and whether or not we will ever know the truth. Some argue that law enforcement is deliberately covering up key details about the shooting while others maintain that we may never know for sure what drove Paddock to commit such a terrible act.
